# Smile Identity Python Server Side SDK

Smile Identity provides the best solutions for real time Digital KYC, Identity Verification, User Onboarding, and User Authentication across Africa. Our server side libraries make it easy to integrate us on the server-side. Since the library is server-side, you will be required to pass the images (if required) to the library.

If you havenâ€™t already, [sign up for a free Smile Identity account](https://www.smileidentity.com/schedule-a-demo/), which comes with Sandbox access.

Please see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for release versions and changes.

The library exposes five classes; the `WebApi` class, the `IDApi` class, the `Signature` class, the `Utilities` class and the `BusinessVerification` class.

- `submit_job` - handles submission of any of Smile Identity products that requires an image i.e. [Biometric KYC](https://docs.smileidentity.com/products/biometric-kyc), [Document Verification](https://docs.smileidentity.com/products/document-verification) and [SmartSelfieTM Authentication](https://docs.smileidentity.com/products/biometric-authentication).
