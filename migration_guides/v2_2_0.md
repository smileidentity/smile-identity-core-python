# Version 2.2.0 Migration Guide

As of version 2.1.3, `use_validation_api` was deprecated. This was used to validate if IDs were supported before running the verification job. This is no longer required and has been removed.

If you don't use `use_validation_api` in `IDApi` and `WebApi` or if you don't use `options_params` in `IdApi`, no action is required.

## IdApi submit method signature

Before

```py
from smile_id_core import IdApi

smile_id_core.submit_job(
        partner_params,
        id_params,
        use_validation_api,
        options_params
    )
```

After

```py
from smile_id_core import IdApi

smile_id_core.submit_job(
        partner_params,
        id_params,
        options_params
    )
```

## WebApi submit method signature

Before

```py
from smile_id_core import WebApi

smile_id_core.submit_job(
        partner_params,
        images_params,
        id_info_params,
        options_params,
        use_validation_api
    )
```

After

```py
from smile_id_core import WebApi

smile_id_core.submit_job(
        partner_params,
        images_params,
        id_info_params,
        options_params
    )
```
